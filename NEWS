		CHANGES IN FLCore VERSION 3.0

NEW FEATURES
	- FLModelSim and FLModelSims new classes
	- [<- FLArray now accepts an input FLQuant and keeps the structure, still recyling
	  as appropriate.
	- New FLStockLen class for length-based stock data and results.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - model.frame(FLComp) now has an mcf=TRUE argument to correct slots of different dim
  - computeLogLik method added to FLModel. Will return a logLik object calculated with
    the data and params in the object
  - New iterMedians(FLQuant) method to applky median along iter dim
  - coerce method for data.frame to FLPar now assumes a 2D structure with iters as rows
    and params as columns
  - rlnorm(FLPar, ...) and rnorm(FLPar, ...) now available
  - mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant) and mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant, matrix) now available
	- propagate(FLComp) now propagates FLPar slots as well
	- FLFleet, FLMetier and FLCatch classes (plus their plurals) and methods have been
	  moved to the FLFleet package
	- ifelse has now been definedx for test="FLQuant"
	- as.data.frame for FLQuant(s) and FLComp now has an option cohort=FALSE to return a
	  column named cohort, calculated as year-age. Ony for age-quanted objects

BUG FIXES
  - iterMeans(FLQuant) was not operating along the 6th dim
	- coerce from FLPar to data.frame now works as expected
	- Added check for range names to FLComp class validity. Elements must be named with
	  non-empty strings and contain, at least, min, max, minyear and maxyear
	- coerce from data.frame to FLPar now handles correctly iters
	- apply(FLArray) did not keep the object units
	- rnorm, rlnorm and rpois did not keep tje object units
