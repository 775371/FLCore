		 CHANGES IN FLCore VERSION 2.6

NEW FEATURES
 - FLModelSim and FLModelSims new classes
 - [<- FLArray now accepts an input FLQuant and keeps the structure, still
   recyling as appropriate.
 - New FLStockLen class for length-based stock data and results.
 - New tS and tS<- method to extract and replace individual time steps in
   an object with
    years and seasons
 - tsp method for FLQuant returns 'tsp' attribute: start, end and frequency
   (seasons)
 - Arith method for FLQuant is now unit-aware, see ?units

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
 - model.frame(FLComp) now has an mcf=TRUE argument to correct slots of
   different dim
 - computeLogLik method added to FLModel. Will return a logLik object
   calculated with the data and params in the object
 - New iterMedians(FLQuant) method to applky median along iter dim
 - coerce method for data.frame to FLPar now assumes a 2D structure with
   iters as rows and params as columns
 - rlnorm(FLPar, ...) and rnorm(FLPar, ...) now available
 - mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant) and mvrnorm(numeric, FLQuant, matrix) now
   available
 - propagate(FLComp) now propagates FLPar slots as well
 - FLFleet, FLMetier and FLCatch classes (plus their plurals) and methods
   have been moved to the FLFleet package
 - ifelse has now been definedx for test="FLQuant"
 - as.data.frame for FLQuant(s) and FLComp now has an option cohort=FALSE to
   return a column named cohort, calculated as year-age. Ony for age-quanted
   objects
 - getPlural is now an S4 method dispatching on singular classes and returning
   the name of the correspoding FLlst-based class
 - as.data.frame(FLQuants) returns qname as factor with levels in the order
   of the input object
 - modified quantile(FLQuant) so dimnames in iter follow quantile(array),
   e.g. 50%
 - tail method for FLQuant, operates by default along the year dimension.

BUG FIXES
 - iterMeans(FLQuant) was not operating along the 6th dim
 - coerce from FLPar to data.frame now works as expected
 - Added check for range names to FLComp class validity. Elements must be named
   with non-empty strings and contain, at least, min, max, minyear and maxyear
 - coerce from data.frame to FLPar now handles correctly iters
 - apply(FLArray) did not keep the object units
 - rnorm, rlnorm and rpois did not keep tje object units
 - code2name for FLSR did not reocngize properly bevholtSV
 - fmle() can now use method="Brent" for one parameter problems
 - New ple4.biol with data up to 2008. No integer value

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT
